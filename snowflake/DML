DELETE 

    - after delete the record we can undo that record useing rollback only if data not commit 
        after commit it won't be possible 
     - in default snowflake is set as auto commit.
      if we want to change the mode we use
      
            alter session set autocommit=false;

delete specific row -

          delete from attendance
          where att_id=2;

delete multiple rows -

          delete from attendance 
          where status = 'off';

delete all rows- 

         delete from attendance;

Delete using join condition - snowflake does not support Delete with join condition direcly

- it removes employees whose emp_id exists in the customers table

            delete employees
            where emp_id in (
                select c-Id from customers);
